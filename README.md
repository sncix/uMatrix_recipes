For those who accidentally stumbled upon this repository:

This is a repository to store my personal ruleset recipes for [uMatrix](https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix/), a browser extension that is now archived and no longer maintained.

An introduction to the syntax of recipes is available in uMatrix's [wiki](https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix/wiki/Ruleset-recipes), which is also the reference I use for writing recipes. Old versions of the built-in recipe collection of uMatrix, such as [this one](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/blob/84dc2761abb4193bb34290aa6d90266610f735f6/recipes/recipes_en.txt), are also available from the git history of the [uAssets](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/) repository. (It has since been removed from uAssets after uMatrix ceased being maintained.)

The recipes in this repository are mostly intended for sncix's personal use. Please understand that there is no assurance that these recipes will be actively maintained or remain available in the future.

All recipes in this repository are licensed under CC0.
